> ### [Preact X](https://github.com/preactjs/preact) codebase containing real world examples (typescript, hooks, wmr, fetch, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **[Preact]** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **[Preact]** community styleguides & best practices.
